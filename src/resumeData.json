Over my schooling and work terms I have been exposed to many languages and frameworks, but some of my favourite languages are Javascript, C and Java. I have recently begun my dive into web development, more specifically using the ReactJS/NodeJS libraries. I hope to explore more full stack opportunities in the future!",
