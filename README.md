Repository for my personal website created using React. Check it out! www.amontague.ca

I also used this as a learning opportunity to explore some JS frameworks and design principles I would normally not have the chance to learn.

I introduced Styled Components and learned how those worked. I really enjoy using them now and love the CSS in JS process. It forces you to be reusable and overall helps your bundle size!
I also used React Router (even though that might have been overkill) to route and plan my site. I never had much experience with this before, so it was good to learn!
Lastly, this has been a nice wake up call to see how hard design and UI/UX is. I can't design for shit and it was tough seeing what worked and what did not. Overall I learned some cool design tips and tricks, and I hope the site does not hurt too bad to look at.
